Project 4 Credit Card Fraud Machine Learning 
# Objective:
**AIR QUALITY**
Air pollution is a critical environmental threat impacting urban populations, particularly in New York City (NYC). This project aims to analyze NYC air quality data to understand pollutant levels, their distribution across neighborhoods, temporal trends, and spatial patterns. The analysis will focus on pollutants such as PM 2.5 and SO2, providing insights into their impacts on public health.
# Analysis Questions:
- What are the average, median, and variability of PM 2.5 measurements across NYC neighborhoods?
- How do SO2 emissions vary across different neighborhoods, and are there specific areas with significantly higher or lower emissions?
- What are the temporal trends in SO2 emissions in specific neighborhoods over the years?
- Are there noticeable seasonal patterns in PM 2.5 pollution levels?
- Which neighborhoods consistently show high levels of PM 2.5 and SO2 emissions?
