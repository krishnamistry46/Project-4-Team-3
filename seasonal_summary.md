Analysis Summary
1. Boiler Emissions

Season	Name	Data Value
Winter	Boiler Emissions- Total NOx Emissions	53.79
Winter	Boiler Emissions- Total PM2.5 Emissions	1.37
Winter	Boiler Emissions- Total SO2 Emissions	10.99
Analysis:

NOx Emissions: Winter has a significantly higher average value (53.79) compared to the summer value of 16.19. This suggests that NOx emissions are notably higher in winter.
PM2.5 Emissions: PM2.5 emissions are considerably lower compared to NOx. The average value in winter is 1.37, which is much less than the summer average of 22.87. However, it's essential to note the large variation in values between seasons.
SO2 Emissions: SO2 emissions also show a higher value in winter (10.99) compared to summer (9.01). This indicates a slight seasonal variation, with winter having marginally higher emissions.
2. Asthma-Related Metrics

Season	Name	Data Value
Winter	Asthma emergency department visits due to PM2.5	65.85
Winter	Asthma emergency departments visits due to Ozone	71.98
Winter	Asthma hospitalizations due to Ozone	12.24
Analysis:

PM2.5 Visits: The average number of asthma emergency department visits due to PM2.5 is notably high in winter (65.85) compared to summer (30.29). This suggests a significant seasonal impact of PM2.5 on asthma-related emergencies during winter.
Ozone Visits: Similarly, the average number of asthma emergency department visits due to ozone is higher in winter (71.98) compared to summer (30.29). This indicates a stronger correlation between ozone levels and asthma-related visits during winter.
Hospitalizations: Hospitalizations due to ozone also show a higher average in winter (12.24) compared to summer (9.46), suggesting that winter has a more considerable impact on hospitalizations due to ozone.
3. Vehicle Miles Traveled

Season	Name	Data Value
Winter	Annual vehicle miles traveled	73.43
Winter	Annual vehicle miles traveled (cars)	67.77
Winter	Annual vehicle miles traveled (trucks)	3.89
Analysis:

Total Vehicle Miles: The average number of annual vehicle miles traveled is significantly higher in winter (73.43) compared to summer (9.46). This indicates increased travel activity during the winter season.
Cars: The average miles traveled by cars is also higher in winter (67.77) compared to summer (9.02). This trend aligns with the increase in total vehicle miles traveled during winter.
Trucks: Miles traveled by trucks show a small value, with a slight increase in winter (3.89) compared to summer (9.02). This suggests that truck travel is less variable between seasons compared to total vehicle miles.
Overall Conclusion:
Boiler Emissions: Winter shows significantly higher NOx emissions compared to summer, with slight increases in SO2 emissions. PM2.5 emissions are lower in winter.
Asthma-Related Metrics: Winter consistently shows higher average values for asthma-related metrics, indicating a stronger seasonal impact of pollutants on asthma.
Vehicle Miles Traveled: There is a notable increase in vehicle miles traveled during winter, with cars contributing significantly to this increase compared to trucks.
These observations suggest that winter has a more pronounced impact on emissions, asthma-related metrics, and vehicle travel, highlighting the importance of seasonal factors in environmental and health metrics.
